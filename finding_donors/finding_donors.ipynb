    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "** Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real life application** For spam filtering applications for email, GaussianNB are very popular and well known.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**  It's a very simple algorithm based around conditional probability and counting. Its called \"naive\" because of its core assumptions of conditional independence i.e. all input features are independent from one and another. If the NB conditional independence assumption actually holds, a Naive Bayes classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models like logistic regression, so one need less training data. And even if the NB assumption doesn’t hold, a NB classifier still often does a great job in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:** It's main disadvantage is that it can't learn interactions between features. It only works well with limited number of features. In addition, there is a high bias when there is a small amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applicability:** After one-hot encoding, our data has a lot of features - 103 in total - which could influence the the type of donor. Naive Bayes could be a good candidate on this basis. Assuming a typical charity environment where high-end hardware is not available for generating the model, this will be a good candidate for lightweight learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Decision Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real life application** Decision Tree can be effectively applied to many real life situation that require binaru classification. Example of this is fraud detection in banking transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:** Trees are very easy to intrepret and explain because they can be displayed graphically and closely mirror human decision making than other classification approaches. Another advantage of decision trees is that they can be applied to data which are not necessarily linearly separable. Trees can handle both numerical and categorical data and large amounts of data can be analysed using standard computing resources in reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:** Trees can be very non-robust i.e., a small change in the data can cause a large change in the final estimated tree. Trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other classification methods. Moreover, decision trees tends to overfit very easily but that’s where ensemble methods like random forests (or boosted trees) come in. Random forests are often the winner for lots of problems in classification, they’re fast and scalable, and you don’t have to worry about tuning a bunch of parameters like you do with SVMs, so they seem to be quite popular choice. Another disadvantage is that they don’t support online learning, so you have to rebuild your tree when new examples come on.Also preparing decision trees, especially large ones with many branches, are complex and time-consuming affairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applicability:** Considering we have a one-hot encoding of features in our dataset, this is well suited to a decision tree. It should also be able to handle lots of data easily, and it is also easy to visualize which would be great for intepretation by Charity ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Support Vector Machine (SVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real life application** Face Recognition - SVMs classify a face and non-face and creates a square boundary around the face.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:** High accuracy, nice theoretical guarantees regarding overfitting, and with an appropriate kernel they can work well even if you’re data isn’t linearly separable in the base feature space. Especially popular in text classification problems where very high-dimensional spaces are the norm. SVM is really helpful for data with lots of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:** SVM don't work well in large data sets because of the growing amounts of time it takes to classify the data. They also dont work well when there are lots of noise in the data as they tend to overfit the data. There is also the need to tweek parameters complicated parameters such as C, Gamma and Kernels to obtain the optimal model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applicability:** Considering we have a binary classification - above or below \\$50k earnings - Support Vector Machines become a good candidate as a model. They're able to fit data well using the kernel trick and produce accurate results.\n",

    "**Answer: ** SVC takes the most time for both model training and model prediction. To examine the model effectiveness we will focus our efforts on the F-score, since it is a more effective and reliable measure of the model performance. Looking at the F-score on the training data, it is clear that the Gaussian NB classifier is the worst performer, Although it seems that the Decision Tree classifier is performing best (with F-score accuracy close to 1), this is probably due to overfitting, thus does not generalize well to unseen data i.e., testing data. On the other hand, GaussianNB delivers a very un-robust and poor accuracy score of 0.3-0.6 on the test and training sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the SVC model has a decent training score and the training score increases as the model os trained on more data. Also, the SVC performs the best on unseen data as is seen in the bottom right graph. Clearly, with this analysis it seems like the SVC is our natural choice of learning algorithm for this particular data set."

    "**Answer: ** A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be employed for  classification problems such as predicting whether a person makes at most \\$50,000 or makes more than \\$50,000. SVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into two classes, as shown in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig1.png\" height=\"350\" width=\"350\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors are the data points nearest to the hyperplane, the points of a data set that, if removed, would alter the position of the dividing hyperplane. Because of this, they can be considered the critical elements of a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a hyperplane?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple example, for a classification task with only two features (like the image above), you can think of a hyperplane as a line that linearly separates and classifies a set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the further from the hyperplane our data points lie, the more confident we are that they have been correctly classified. We therefore want our data points to be as far away from the hyperplane as possible, while still being on the correct side of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when new testing data is added, whatever side of the hyperplane it lands will decide the class that we assign to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do we find the right hyperplane?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, in other words, how do we best segregate the two classes within the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from either set is known as the margin. The goal is to choose a hyperplane with the greatest possible margin between the hyperplane and any point within the training set, giving a greater chance of new data being classified correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig2.png\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But what happens when there is no clear hyperplane?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where it can get tricky. Data is rarely ever as clean as our simple example above. A dataset will often look more like the jumbled balls below which represent a linearly non separable dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig3.png\" height=\"300\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to classify a dataset like the one above it’s necessary to move away from a 2d view of the data to a 3d view. Explaining this is easiest with another simplified example. Imagine that our two sets of colored balls above are sitting on a sheet and this sheet is lifted suddenly, launching the balls into the air. While the balls are up in the air, you use the sheet to separate them. This ‘lifting’ of the balls represents the mapping of data into a higher dimension. This is known as kernelling. You can read more on Kerneling [here](http://www.eric-kim.net/eric-kim-net/posts/1/kernel_trick.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fig4.png\" height=\"300\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are now in three dimensions, our hyperplane can no longer be a line. It must now be a plane as shown in the example above. The idea is that the data will continue to be mapped into higher and higher dimensions until a hyperplane can be formed to segregate it.\n",

The optimized model does do slightly better than the unoptimized model with an accuracy score on the testing data = 0.8395 compared to an accuracy score on testing data = 0.8371 for the unoptimized model.

Of course job title matters, a manager makes much more than its subordinate employee.\n",

    "3. **Age:** The income, in general, is proportionate to experience and thereby age. For instance, with two people who have similar qualifications, the one who is younger indirectly means that they have less work experience, and thus probably make entry level salary according to his/her degree. On the other hand, the more experienced you are, possibly, you stepped up the ladder with an improved job title, hence enjoy a fatter paycheck.\n",

    "- We can see from the bar graph above that the feature that plays the most important role is 'education-number'. While it generally makes sense that the longer a person spends in school the more specialized skills/degree they should have. However, it remains to be known whether these years are measuring time for all full time students or also part time students. For example, a student who finishes a courese part time will take more years to complete than someone who is a full time student, although they both end up with the same degree. \n",
    "- As we suspected age plays a big role in determining ones income as is evident through the feature selection process. \n",
    "- The feature selection process also came up with 'marital-status', 'capital-loss' and 'capital-gain' as three other important features that determine ones salary bracket. Initially these factors did not seem as important as 'occupation', 'work-class' and 'gender'. For this particular data set, the feature importance is a little bit surprising for a general understanding."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
